# Regev's Algorithm — Artifact Repository

This repository contains reproducibility artifacts for the Firebringer-Quantum Regev/ECDLP experiments.

## QDay Challenge (Project 11)

The push-ready artifact bundle for the 14-bit run is here:

- `artifacts/qday_project11/14bit_job_d5c0u30nsj9s73b9351g/`

Inside that folder you will find:

- The publish-ready paper (`ECDLP_Quantum_Cryptanalysis_Paper.docx`)
- Raw IBM Runtime job payloads (`job-*-info.json`, `job-*-result.json`)
- Plot script and generated plots (`make_ecdlp_plots.py`, `*.png`, `plot_data.*.json`)
- Supporting scripts and requirements

Open the artifact folder README for exact reproduction steps.
